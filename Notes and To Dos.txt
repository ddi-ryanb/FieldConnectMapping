- Field connect mapping is intended to provide users with a mapping of field connector pins to information relevant to EtherCAT & Interlock Builder
- Field connect mapping shall contain:
	- Field connector details for all field connectors
		- Connector name
		- Type of field connector (e.g. DB25F, DB15M, Molex 8 pin, etc.)
		- All pins for each field connector
	- Slot card details
		- Channel type
		- Slot number
		- Channel #
	- EtherCAT details
		- Module #
		- Input or Output type
		- Bit offset
		- Bit size
	- Interlock Builder details
		- I/O ID

- Relevant files/details
	- List of field connectors (CSV)
	- Netlist (PADS format)
	- Fusion system ODS file
	- Process data variables (from EC Engineer?)

Notes & To Dos
- Complete list of field connector pins
- Review
	- JHTR PDU
	- P25
- Verify FC mapping against manually built ASM
- Establish relationship between ECAT module # and slot #
- Process variable parser
- Save FC mapping to CSV
- ODS file parser
- Check on the relationship between slot # and corner connector pin groupings (e.g. JS1A, JS2B, etc.)
	- JM confirmed that there is a static relationship between corner connector group and slot #
- Check for and prevent corner connector group assignments
- Save and load slot card configuration
- Fused power connections need to have net aliases assigned
- ODS file Config sheet fucntion: int format_config_sheet(sys_config_t *sys, xmlNode *sheet)
- ODS config recommendations:
	- DI/DO/AI/AO assignements should start from 1, not 0
	- Assignments should follow order of slots and channels
